Design API endpoints¶
You’ll build an API that provides access to a store selling vintage recordings on vinyl. So you’ll need to provide endpoints through which a client can get and add albums for users.

When developing an API, you typically begin by designing the endpoints. Your API’s users will have more success if the endpoints are easy to understand.

Here are the endpoints you’ll create in this tutorial.

/albums

GET – Get a list of all albums, returned as JSON.
POST – Add a new album from request data sent as JSON.
/albums/:id

GET – Get an album by its ID, returning the album data as JSON.
Next, you’ll create a folder for your code.
